 VBA Challenge
Hello, here is my submission for Module 2- VBA Challenge





I have created a script which loops through all the worksheets at once and outputs the following information:

1. The ticker symbol

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock. 

Additionally, the script also return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

I have attached my VBA script with submission for easier understanding of my thought process while completing this task.

Thank you!
